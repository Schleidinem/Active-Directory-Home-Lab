# Windows-Server-Hybrid-Environment---Personal-Home-Lab

## Objective:

This repository documents a basic cybersecurity  lab using VirtualBox, a Windows 10 VM (defender/telemetry target), and a Kali VM (tooling). It emphasizes safety, isolation, and snapshots without risking my host machine or network.

## Skilled Learned

** VM provisioning and checksum verification

** Secure network isolation (Hostâ€‘Only + NAT)

** Snapshots and safe rollback workflows

** Baseline telemetry on Windows (e.g., logs, Defender, Sysmon optional)

** Ethical use of common tooling to understand alerts & detections
